# DroneDome

In order to train the AI please use this pull from stable-baselines3:
https://github.com/J-Travnik/stable-baselines3/tree/feat/dict_observations

Then install airsim and put droneTrain.py inside of pythonClient/riencforcmentLearning and 
replace airgym/envs/drone_env and airsim_env with our updated one.

(In progress)If you would like to use the app to test out your AI then put the AI file path 
inside of droneAI.py and run the server then run the app and enjoy.
